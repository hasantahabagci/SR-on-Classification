# SR-on-Classification
This repository is dedicated to exploring the impact of various super-resolution (SR) methods on the performance of image classification models. By enhancing low-resolution images using different SR techniques, we aim to investigate how the quality of image resolution affects the accuracy of classifying images into predefined categories.
